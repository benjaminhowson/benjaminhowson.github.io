    Play Bandits is an interactive game where you must exercise your 
    ability to make decisions in uncertain environments. 
    Explore. Exploit.
    See whether your intuition can outsmart the provably efficient algorithms
    developed over the past century.

    How many samples I you need? 
    What is the smallest effect I can detect? 
    What power do I get with this design? 
    The Z-Test power function allows you to answer all of these questions.
    Just tweak the inputs until you are happy with your experimental design.
