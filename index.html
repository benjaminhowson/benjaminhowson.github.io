	    <p> Hello, welcome to my website and landing page! I built this from scratch using HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript.</p>

	    <p> I am a PhD student at Imperial College London and am part of the <a href="https://statml.io/" style = "color:#3EB489">StatML Programme</a>. My supervisors are <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~cpikebur/" style="color:#3EB489">Ciara Pike-Burke</a> and <a href = "https://sarahfilippi.github.io/" style = "color:#3EB489">Sarah Filippi</a>.</p>
            
	    <p> My research focuses on variations of the classical bandit and reinforcement learning problems. These variations include some of the salient features found in real-world applications, such as delayed feedback, human feedback, and distributed multi-agent decision-making. During my PhD, I interned at ASOS and focussed on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for personalisation. Here, there were hard external constraints placed on the decision-making and the solution that we developed combined classical algorithms with integer linear programming. </p>

	    <p> Broadly, I am interested in all things machine learning and am always keen to learn about new topics. My favourite kinds of problems are those that solve real-world challenges and those where you can find a nice connection to different fields of mathematics. Recently, I have been thinking about learning under model-dependent distribution shifts and how we should use the data the models collect to update their parameters. This problem is a common concern in real-world applications and analysing the behaviour of common re-training schemes requires tools from real analysis, fixed-point theory and optimisation. I am also interested in making machine learning quick. I find it very satisfying to find tweaks and tricks that make programmes run faster.</p>

		    <span class = "publication-abstract"> Developing algorithms for multi-agent decision-making problems is challenging. Getting theoretical guarantees for these algorithms is even harder. QuACK is a black-box approach that tackles both of these challenges. Specifically, it takes in any bandit algorithm as input and automatically turns it into an algorithm for multi-agent settings. Mathematically, we guarantee that using our approach allows you to inherit the theoretical guarantees of your chosen bandit algorithm. The guarantees that come out are comparable to or better than existing approaches that have carefully extended bandit algorithms on a case-by-case basis. Experimentally, we show that our general-purpose approach offers empirical performance that is comparable to or better than existing work.</span>

		    <span class = "publication-abstract"> Discounts are a powerful mechanism for managing customer relationships and operational spending in e-commerce. DISCO is an end-to-end contextual bandit framework for personalising this mechanism. Thompson Sampling is leveraged to adapt to new information. This algorithm is nested within an integer programming scheme. The latter is required to allow the marketing and finance teams to elicit hard constraints on the discounts chosen by the randomised bandit algorithm at the population level. Running A/B testing live on the website found that this approach significantly increased profitability against legacy systems.</span>

		    <span class = "publication-abstract"> Traditional contextual bandit algorithms perform well in practical applications. These empirical successes are unsupported by the theory because feedback is almost always delayed. Previously, it was suggested that modifications of well-known algorithms are necessary and that the delays cause a multiplicative degradation in performance. However, we provide theoretical results that better align with practical implementations and empirical observations. Our analysis shows that running contextual bandit algorithms without modification gives an additive penalty for delayed feedback. Thus, once the rewards are sufficiently well-estimated, the impact of the delays disappears. Furthermore, we identify that this is only the case when the delays are independent of the rewards.</span>

		    <span class = "publication-abstract"> There are many algorithms for regret minimisation in reinforcement learning. However, all the guarantees are for the immediate feedback setting. This paper proposes meta-algorithms for handling delayed feedback, namely active and lazy. Active updates the immediate feedback algorithm as soon as new information arrives. Lazy algorithmically introduces more delays by waiting before updating. Theoretically, we provide theoretical guarantees for the class of optimistic algorithms and show that introducing more delays is an effective tool for improving the worst-case performance.</span>
